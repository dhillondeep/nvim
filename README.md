# Nvim
This is my personal Neovim configuration! It uses [NvChad](https://nvchad.com/) as base configuration and it is further customized to make it easier to use for development.

## Install
Clone the repo to some directory on your machine:
```
git clone https://github.com/dhillondeep/nvim.git ~/.nvim-config
```

Run `install.sh` script:
```
cd ~/.nvim-config
./install.sh
```

Open neovim and run `:PackerSync` and `:Mason`
```
nvim
:PackerSync
:Mason
```
